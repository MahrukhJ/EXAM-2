For this exam we will use a new (to you) dataset, an update of NHIS. We will look at estimates of 
whether people worked for an employer that offered health insurance, EMPHI. The data is available on Slack.
(Note that in data, NIU is "Not in Universe" so for instance if people are asked if their employer offers health 
insurance then somebody not working would be NIU.)

1. 
I have run crosstabs on a subset of the data (so you cannot replicate, just use this info provided). 
These give verbose summary of whether employer offers health insurance by educational qualification and 
whether person is full or part time worker. Form a hypothesis test of the form, "people with *various* 
educational qualifications who are *full or parttime* have different fraction offered health insurance." 
I expect that you will choose different ways to operationalize educational qualification (compare above some
level with below that level, but what level?). You can choose how to deal with NA and similar responses. I 
expect that different people may choose different levels of significance. Please provide estimate, standard 
error, t-stat and a p-value for the hypothesis test and a confidence interval. __Write a short paragraph__ 
explaining the test (carefully noting what is the null hypothesis) and explaining the results of that test.

Null Hypothesis: People with a bachelors degree who work fulltime have no significant difference in the fraction of people who are offered health insurance.
Alternative Hypothesis: People with a bachelors degree who work fulltime have a different fraction of people who are offered health insurance.
